SEGMENTATION RULES FOR DATA CLOUD

Segment Creation Rules:
- Always include clear segment criteria documentation
- Use incremental processing for large segments
- Implement proper segment refresh strategies
- Design segments with reusability in mind

Segment Criteria Guidelines:
- Use calculated insights for dynamic segmentation
- Implement proper segment testing before activation
- Avoid creating too many overlapping segments
- Use clear and specific criteria for segment definition

Performance Optimization:
- Use incremental processing for large segments
- Implement proper segment refresh schedules
- Be cautious with real-time segment evaluation
- Monitor segment processing performance

Segment Management:
- Don't use segments without proper refresh schedules
- Regularly review and update segment criteria
- Archive or delete unused segments
- Document segment purposes and usage

Best Practices:
- Test segments in development environments first
- Use descriptive names for segments
- Implement proper segment versioning
- Monitor segment performance and usage metrics
