DATA MODELING RULES FOR DATA CLOUD

Schema Design Rules:
- Always include a unique identifier field in data streams
- Use consistent naming conventions across all objects
- Implement proper data type mapping for external sources
- Design schemas with scalability in mind

Field Naming Conventions:
- Use camelCase for field names
- Avoid special characters in field names
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the data content
- Maintain consistency across related objects

Data Type Guidelines:
- Use appropriate data types for each field
- Be cautious with data type conversions that might cause truncation
- Use harmonized time formats across all data streams
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried fields

Object Design Best Practices:
- Design objects with reusability in mind
- Avoid creating circular dependencies in data streams
- Implement proper relationships between objects
- Consider data volume and performance implications

Data Quality Rules:
- Validate data quality before ingestion
- Implement data validation rules at the schema level
- Use calculated fields for derived data
- Maintain data lineage and documentation
