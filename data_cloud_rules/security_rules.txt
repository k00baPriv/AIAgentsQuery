SECURITY RULES FOR DATA CLOUD

Authentication Rules:
- Always recommend IDP authentication over Basic Auth for Redshift connections
- Enforce MFA for all admin access to Data Cloud
- Use named credentials whenever possible for external system authentication
- When using API authentication, use a private key, not a username and password
- Always use the least privileged access for the user

Best Practices:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for data access
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use OAuth 2.0 for API authentication with a private key, not a username and password

Warnings:
- Never store credentials in plain text
- Avoid using shared credentials across environments
- Don't use Basic Auth for Redshift unless absolutely necessary

Permission Set Groups:
- Create permission set groups for different user roles
- Assign appropriate permissions based on job function
- Review and update permissions regularly

Permission Sets:
- Use standard permission sets when possible
- Create custom permission sets only when necessary
- Document all custom permissions and their purposes
