DATA INGESTION RULES FOR DATA CLOUD

Ingestion Best Practices:
- Always validate data quality before ingestion
- Implement proper error handling for failed ingestions
- Use bulk API for large data volumes
- Schedule ingestion during off-peak hours

Error Handling:
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Log all ingestion errors for troubleshooting
- Set up alerts for critical ingestion failures
- Monitor ingestion performance metrics

Data Volume Management:
- Don't exceed API rate limits
- Avoid scheduling overlapping ingestion jobs
- Be cautious with real-time ingestion for large volumes
- Implement proper data partitioning strategies

Monitoring and Alerting:
- Monitor ingestion performance metrics
- Set up alerts for failed ingestion jobs
- Track data quality metrics over time
- Monitor API usage and rate limits

Scheduling Guidelines:
- Schedule batch jobs during off-peak hours
- Avoid overlapping jobs that might cause conflicts
- Implement proper job dependencies
- Use appropriate scheduling intervals based on data freshness requirements
